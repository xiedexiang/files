We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -uroot

mysql@5.7 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have mysql@5.7 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/include"

For pkg-config to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/lib/pkgconfig"


To restart mysql@5.7 after an upgrade:
  brew services restart mysql@5.7
